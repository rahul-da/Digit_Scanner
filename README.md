# Digit_Scanner
Scans the digit by looking at an image of it
you have to run in your matlab or octave software.
a sample training set is provided.
two methods are used here.One is regularization of regression taking its sigmoid function and finding its maximum probability of being which digit.
digit 0 is indexed 10 as octave indexes its arrays from 1.
second method is the forward propagation of neural networks.
I have not added the program for computing the parameters but used calculated ones.
a commit of adding parameters/weights program will be highly appreciated.
run it and enjoy.
the functions are named according to task.
you just have to run regularization_result.m and neural_network.m
enjoy
